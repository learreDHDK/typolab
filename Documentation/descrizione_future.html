		<h2>2020-2040: Holographic Escape</h2>
		<p>Given the current environmental issues our society is challenged to face and the risks we’re exposed to, it was unfortunately easy to think to a dystopic future. Inspired by landscapes as Blade Runner’s city, we chose to set our theme in ten years or so from now, in a rainy overcrowded city, where advertisement is invasive and pollution is just ignored, as it’s too difficult to fight. We imagined this hypothetical city in China, since it already counts several megacities.</p>

		<p>In such a context, we imagined a typographical style which tries to remind the nature, almost lost, surely stranger and exotic for the majority of the inhabitants. The elements are chosen from the forest landscape since it’s one of the most common landscape one would think when referring to nature. However, it can be noticed that there are some association errors, unperceivable to the ones who are not familiar with this landscape. The designer, not familiar with the landscape, has chosen what he perceived as natural elements. Nature will be a so distant concept that it will be easy to do small mistakes, as when you talk of something you are not so experienced about.</p>

		<p>Inspired by the most updated tendencies in web design and by our perception of “futuristic”, we thought this representation should be minimal. This choice is also strictly dependent from the context: in this chaotic environment, where everything is colorful and big to catch the attention, escaping in the reading dimension will probably mean refuging in a chill place, an idyllic shelter, which is completely opposite to the surrounding environment: black and white, small, standalone.</p>
		<p>The reading support will probably keep evolving. In the last decade we assisted to the establishment of the smartphone but also several device experiments who have not persisted. We imagined a support which frees the reader from the device, as the hologram, interposed between the subject and the surrounding environment, projected by a small invisible device (e.g. a watch).</p>

		<p>The reading in web has already changed a lot towards a non-linear dimension, so we imagined a future experience in which the reader can see at first glance the article as a whole and choose what attracts him most through the finger. This type of interaction is here simulated through the cursor, which is indeed absent in the background.</p>
