		<h2>Prehistoric Web</h2>
	      <p>
			One of the current fashions for websites is the so-called "web brutalism". It was born in 2017 and is characterized by “raw” sites, cut to the bone, where text games are predominant, where extraneous graphic elements cohexist between them and where usability and user experience are not the priority. This movement is designed to create a unexpected aesthetic alternative to the canons of today's web design.
	      </p>
	      <p>
			Starting from this trend, we decided to recreate the look of the first websites, those of the 90s, which were pure experimentation of a totally new world. The elements present in these "prehistoric" sites are very far from our idea of websites.

	      <p>
			Thanks to the "oldwebtoday" web page (http://oldweb.today/), which allows us to visualize the look of the web pages on a certain date, we were able to explore the websites starting from 1991. Among the several features, we noticed that the pointer was black and its appearance when moved over a link took the shape of a hand different from the one we know today. Hence, we changed the appearance of the pointer thanks to the cursor and the a:hover properties.

			Analyzing a series of documents, we noticed some features that we then recreated and applied to our documents. Below we can see them:
		<ul>
		  <li>underlined links in blue that become purple once visited</li>
		  <li>text aligned on the left</li>
		  <li>marquee effect (scrolling text); that in the 90s was recreated using the &lt;marquee&gt; html tag, but which in our case was created using css and text animations</li>
		  <li>the blink effect (flashing characters)</li>
		  <li>animated gifs</li>
		  <li>the pixel fonts</li>
		  <li>use of default fonts (because not customizable)</li>
		  <li>the glow effect</li>
		  <li>use of the 16 default colors</li>
		  <li>the background characterized by the repetition of an image</li>
		  <li>the border of the tables non-collapsed</li>
		</ul>
