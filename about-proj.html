        <h2>The project</h2>
        <p>The TYPOlab project was developed for the "Information Modeling and Web Technologies" course of the Master Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge of the University of Bologna.</p>
        <p>The goal/purpose of the project was the creation of six typographic(al?) themes that are immediately linkable to the style of a document in a specific historical period.</p>
        <p>The first step was the choice of the reference period and the following research which lead us to find and observe the documents of that time, to manage to (catturare) the style, the colors, the dimensions. Once obtained the necessary information, we tried to recreate the typographic(al?) styles using the CSS.</p> 
        <p>[We applied the resulting themes on six documents of different lenghts and nature.] However, the peculiarity of these themes is their (ability) to fit every HTML document, provided that it was written using generic tags. The CSS files very often (utilizzano) selectors and pseudo-classes which enable the reproduction of the themes even on documents (which they were not designed for).</p>
        <p>[On this website, you can visualize the themes and their application on the articles, by clicking on two distinct widgets in the "Try" page].</p>
        <h2>Our themes</h2>
        <p>Here below you can have an initial preview/hint of the typographic themes. We tried to add to the temporal distance, the geographical one.</p>
        <p>Clicking on the dates on the timeline it is possible to visualize a description of the related theme and at the same time see their geographic provenance on the map.</p>

              <p>This theme is inspired by the newspapers of this epoch which was greatly influenced by the automatic creation of paper at low cost since we had the second industrial revolution. Due to this, there was also a massive growth in overall circulation as major events and improved communications developed the public's need for information with literacy rising sharply. This favored the outburst of many newspapers such as The Times, The Courier and The Daily just to name a few.</p>
