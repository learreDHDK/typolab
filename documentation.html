      		<h2>Aldo Manuzio</h2>

	      <p>
		<img src="themes/bef1500/documentation/anchor.jpg">
		<img src="themes/bef1500/documentation/italic.jpg">
		The starting point for this theme are the “edizioni aldine”, the books printed by Aldo Manuzio, one of the major publishers of all time and one of the first modern publishers in Europe.
		Manuzio invented the so called “edizioni in ottavo”, opposed to the bulky incunabula of the previous decade. In this way, the act of reading became more easily accessible for everyone.
		Another innovation provided by Manuzio was the italic, specifically created for him by the engraver Francesco Griffo, in Bologna.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		<img src="themes/bef1500/documentation/margin.jpg">
		The printing mark of Manuzio represented an anchor surrounded by a dolphin and is displayed with the motto “festina lente”. This drawing is depicted on every first page of each edition. To recreate the layout of the pages, we used a parchment background-color and we set very wide margins, trying to reproduce the ratio of the pages. <b>Checking some editions we observed that the ratio between margins follows this rules: 1 inner, 2 top, 2.5 outer, 3 bottom; and that the text occupies the 60% of the page width (that is 10-15 words for each line).</b>
	      </p>

	      <p>
		The font used for this theme is the Flanker Griffo, that is one of the so called “veneziani” font, which tries to reproduce the typeface of the edizioni aldine. To try to make it more similar to the original one, we decreased the spacing between characters (letter-spacing) and we used only the bold and the italic versions. The first row of each paragraph is indented (text-indent).
	      </p>

	      <p>
	      <img src="themes/bef1500/documentation/caption.jpg">
	      <img src="themes/bef1500/documentation/frame.jpg">
		Images and tables are surrounded with a double frame, created using the border and the outline property. Captions are in uppercase and are situated in the lower part of the images.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		<img src="themes/bef1500/documentation/floral-dropcap.jpg">
		<img src="themes/bef1500/documentation/dropcap.jpg">
		The pages of these editions are rather straight(?), but are characterized by floral decorations and decorated drop caps. To reproduce this effect, we used the drawing of an original dropcap and we set it as background-image of every first letter of every section of the text.

      	<h2>Prehistoric Web</h2>

	      <p>
		One of the current fashions for websites is the so-called "web brutalism". It was born in 2017 and is characterized by “raw” sites, cut to the bone, where text games are predominant, where extraneous graphic elements cohexist between them and where usability and user experience are not the priority. This movement is designed to create a unexpected aesthetic alternative to the canons of today's web design.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Starting from this trend, we decided to recreate the look of the first websites, those of the 90s, which were pure experimentation of a totally new world. The elements present in these "prehistoric" sites are very far from our idea of websites.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Thanks to the "oldwebtoday" web page (http://oldweb.today/), which allows us to visualize the look of the web pages on a certain date, we were able to explore the websites starting from 1991. Among the several features, we noticed that the pointer was black and its appearance when moved over a link took the shape of a hand different from the one we know today. Hence, we changed the appearance of the pointer thanks to the cursor and the a:hover properties.
	      </p>

	      <p>
		Analyzing a series of documents, we noticed some features that we then recreated and applied to our documents. Below we can see them:
		<ul>
		  <li>underlined links in blue that become purple once visited</li>
		  <li>text aligned on the left</li>
		  <li>marquee effect (scrolling text); that in the 90s was recreated using the &lt;marquee&gt; html tag, but which in our case was created using css and text animations</li>
		  <li>the blink effect (flashing characters)</li>
		  <li>animated gifs</li>
		  <li>the pixel fonts</li>
		  <li>use of default fonts (because not customizable)</li>
		  <li>the glow effect</li>
		  <li>use of the 16 default colors</li>
		  <li>the background characterized by the repetition of an image</li>
		  <li>the border of the tables non-collapsed</li>
		</ul>
	      </p>

	      <p>
		When the page is opened, you can hear the sound of the dial-up connection.
