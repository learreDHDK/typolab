		                        <h2>AFRICAN INDEPENCE POLITICAL COMEMORATIVE TEXTILE PRINTS</h2>
<p>The second half of the 20th century in Africa blew a wind of change in the governance of many countries of the continent; this in the sense that many countries acquired their independence from the colonial masters this during the late 50s and all through the 60s. During this period, African type was not very developed on paper but the main type and way of communicating this glorious epoch was through the textile Political commemorative prints locally called "kangas" in East Africa, “Aso-ebi” in Nigeria, “Indigo” in West Africa.  This modern West African commemorative fabric fashion began with the creative expropriation of Dutch "Wax" imported Indonesian style textiles in Ghana and elsewhere. This was to commemorate events and people of great importance during this period and these cotton fabrics consist of large blocks of bright colour and intricate designs, often with photographic imagery on one side. Having this in mind, I decided to create a theme which could better represent this trend and also added some western world elements. In the following lines, I clearly express all the details of my choices.</p>

<p><b>HEADER:</b> 
In the header, I tried to copy the layout style of an African book published in 1950 by tiltle  <b>Loula – Le fétiche ensorcelé</b> by Noëlle Norman, with illustrations by J. A. Dupuich. In this example, you have the h1 above the image, the h2 and the other element at the bottom. I  tryed to respect the fonts, sizes and margins.</p>

                  <figcaption>fig1. I copied the style replacing the colors with the ones of my choice.</figcaption>
                  </figure>
                                
<p><b>BODY:</b>
 The body style of this theme is in memory of the simple posters used during the independence declaration i.e. black ink on white paper. But the layout is in the sense of the layout of the book of reference for the padding, font size, margin and the border of the text which is an image on both left and right sides. But, my choice was to make the border image outside and not inside to leave the poster paper effect and make it be like on an African dress. In the text, the little asides are in resemblance to the pieces of papers on which the various independence messages where written. The highlighted pieces of text in the main text are to also imitate the fact that important information during this epoch was in uppercase and bold.</p>

                  <figcaption> fig2. Copied the font family and size, padding and box border.</figcaption>
                  </figure>
      
<p><b>Font:</b> the fonts used are font of this period. But not having great information concerning the fonts used for the prints on the textile clothes nor the posters, I used the fonts suggested by the African published book tiltle  Loula – Le fétiche ensorcelé by Noëlle Norman, with illustrations by J. A. Dupuich of that era which were: <b>Elegant light, Veltro and Futura.</b></p>
 <p>Not being able to find the original font of Elegant Light I downloaded  a similar font.</p>

                  <figcaption> fig3. Suggested fonts in use of the epoch. </figcaption>
                  </figure>
<ul>
<li><b>Veltro W01 Regular (1934) :</b> for the footer</li>
<li><b>Helvetica Bold (1857) :</b> for the emphasis and asides in the text</li>
<li><b>FuturaLT-Light (1927) :</b> for the paragraphs in all the text.</li>
<li><b>Arya W00 Double (2009) :</b> for the h1 in the text to replace the font elegant light</li>
<li><b>Moonshiner-Regular (2013) :</b> for the h2 of the text as it is on the reference text I selected</li>
<li><b>ArterioNonCommercial (2019) :</b> for the first letter of the text as in the reference text. This is not the exact font but I tried to search for a font which looks like the original font.</li>
<li><b>Impact (1965) :</b> for the asides in the text.</li></ul>

<p><b>Images:</b> the images in this theme are a representation of the photos of the presidents used on the textile prints of this period to celebrate the independence of African continents. The images are all grayscale as those of the past but some images also of the past had some colour. I therefore added the hover effect on images to have this colour effect.</p>

<p><b>First letter text:</b> from the reference text. As you can see, the text of reference is in pink but I decided to take a background image for my drop cap which rhymes with the colours of my text but the idea remains the same.</p>

<p><b>Borders:</b> the borders of the images and text are created to add an effect of background to the images to have the effect of being on an African clothe.</p>
