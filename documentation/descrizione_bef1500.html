		<h2>Aldo Manuzio</h2>

			The starting point for this theme are the “edizioni aldine”, the books printed by Aldo Manuzio, one of the major publishers of all time and one of the first modern publishers in Europe.
			Manuzio invented the so called “edizioni in ottavo”, opposed to the bulky incunabula of the previous decade. In this way, the act of reading became more easily accessible for everyone.
			Another innovation provided by Manuzio was the italic, specifically created for him by the engraver Francesco Griffo, in Bologna.

			The printing mark of Manuzio represented an anchor surrounded by a dolphin and is displayed with the motto “festina lente”. This drawing is depicted on every first page of each edition. To recreate the layout of the pages, we used a parchment background-color and we set very wide margins, trying to reproduce the ratio of the pages. Checking some editions we observed that the ratio between margins follows this rules: 1 inner, 1.2 top, 1.3 outer, 1.5 bottom; and that the text occupies the 60% of the page width (that is 10-15 words for each line).
	    </p>
	    <p>
			The font used for this theme is the Flanker Griffo, that is one of the so called “veneziani” font, which tries to reproduce the typeface of the edizioni aldine. To try to make it more similar to the original one, we decreased the spacing between characters (letter-spacing) and we used only the bold and the italic versions. The first row of each paragraph is indented (text-indent).

			Images and tables are surrounded with a double frame, created using the border and the outline property. Captions are in uppercase and are situated in the lower part of the images.

			The pages of these editions are rather straight(?), but are characterized by floral decorations and decorated drop caps. To reproduce this effect, we used the drawing of an original dropcap and we set it as background-image of every first letter of every section of the text.
