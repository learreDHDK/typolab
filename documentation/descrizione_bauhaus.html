		<h2>Bauhaus</h2>
		<p>The theme for the first half of XXth century is inspired by the design of Staatliches Bauhaus, the art school founded by Walter Gropius in 1919 in Weimar and active until 1933. The movement focused on and influenced many fields over the years, included typography. Our starting point for the development of the theme was the short treatise of László Moholy-Nagy, Bauhaus’ teacher, contained in the exhibition catalog of the school in 1923. His indications best entail the instances of the movement which we tried to represent in our project:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p><em>Unequivocal clarity.</em> Since «Typography is a tool of communication», legibility and clarity come before aesthetics. Sans-serif font <b>Futura</b> was also born under this kind of intent in 1927: the designer Paul Renner, close to the ideas of Bauhaus although not associated, rejected the approach of previous sans-serif designs (now often called grotesques), which were based on nineteenth-century serif typefaces, in favour of simple geometric forms. View the great use that the font found in Bauhaus’ publications, we adopted it in our theme. We alternated it with Mandala, a font inspired by Herbert Bayer's <b>Universal</b> typeface, a simple geometric sans-serif font characterized by the absence of capital letters, born inside Bauhaus in 1925.</p></li>

			<li><p><em>Elasticity, variability and freshness of typographical composition.</em> Moholy-Nagy stressed the need of using <b>all linear directions</b> and to think of letters outside of their «preconceived framework». In this perspective, space becomes a dynamic component in typographic layout. He also highlighted: «We use <b>all typefaces, type sizes, geometric forms, colors</b>».</p></li>

			<li><p><em>The new poster relies on photography […] combined with the shock effect of new typefaces and brilliant color effects.</em> Moholy Nagy is also well known for Typophoto, result of the combination of photography and typographical line. Since it is impossible to reproduce it without referring to the content, in the effort of creating the same «immediate impact on all psychological receptacles», we used instead some of its features, i.e. brilliant colors and bold graphical effects. These effects were inspired by Cubism study of space, which deeply influenced Bauhaus design’s choices. Cubists revealed a deconstruction of space into rectangles, triangles and ellipses and added a fourth dimension, time, which made the composition complex and rather unwieldy. These <b>graphical effects</b> make figures and tables emerge from the whitespace.</p></li>

		</ul>
		<p>Finally, for the quotes separated from the text, we added edge <b>bars to lock the composition</b>, as Jan Tschichold did. He didn’t attend Bauhaus nor work there, but visited and corresponded with teachers of the school.</p>

		<p>Our main source of inspiration, especially for the header, was a book of the series of fourteen <b>‘Bauhausbücher’</b> (Bauhaus Books), that Moholy-Nagy designed in collaboration with Walter Gropius: <em>Staatliches Bauhaus Weimar 1919-1923, László Moholy-Nagy, Bauhaus Verlag, Weimar. 1923.</em></p>
