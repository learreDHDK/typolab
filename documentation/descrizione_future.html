		<h2>2020-2040: Holographic Escape</h2>
		<p>Given the current environmental issues our society is challenged to face and the risks we are exposed to, it was unfortunately easy to think to a <b>dystopic future</b>. Inspired by landscapes as Blade Runner’s city, we chose to set our theme in ten years or so from now, in a <b>rainy overcrowded city</b>, where advertisement is invasive and pollution is just ignored, as it’s too difficult to fight. We imagined this hypothetical city in China, since it already counts a great number of megacities, which is likely to increase in the future. The background GIF drives us into this context.</p>

		</figure>
		<p>In such a context, we imagined a potential reader that is searching for a dimension where to chill from the chaotic environment that surrounds him: an idyllic shelter, as the nature. So the page presents <b>natural elements from the forest landscape</b> since it’s one of the most common landscape one would think about when referring to nature. Surely it would result stranger and exotic for the majority of the inhabitants, but we further imagine it would be a distant concept also for the creator of the page, who makes some <b>association mistakes</b>, unperceivable to the ones who are not familiar with this landscape, for what concerns the relationship between the single elements: the pine cone doesn't properly belong to the trees represented, nor do the rondini usually fly over the forest. As happens in other contexts, the designer is not familiar with the subject and has just a superficial knowledge, so he chooses what he perceived as natural elements.</p>
		<p>Inspired by the most updated tendencies in web design and by our perception of “futuristic”, we thought this representation should be <b>minimal</b>: black and white, with small standalone elements, and a font in the body which has no particular features, as Caslon, still one of the most common fonts for long texts, that will probably be used also in the future. This choice is also strictly dependent from the context: in a chaotic environment, where everything is colorful and big to catch the attention, escaping in the reading dimension will probably mean refuging in a chill place, an idyllic shelter, which is completely opposite to the surrounding environment: black and white, small, with standalone elements.</p>
		<p>The reading support will probably keep evolving. In the last decade we assisted to the establishment of the smartphone but also several devices experiments who have not persisted. We imagined a support which frees the reader from the device, as the <b>hologram</b>, interposed between the subject and the surrounding environment, projected by a small invisible device (e.g. a watch). Images, tables and links present a shadow, as if they are 3D, popping out from the background.</p>

			<figcaption style="width:100%; padding-bottom:3%;">Already today is possible</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>Reading in web has already changed a lot towards a <b>non-linear dimension</b>, so we imagined a future experience in which the reader can see at first glance the article as a whole and choose what attracts him most through the touch of the finger. This type of interaction is here simulated through the cursor, which is indeed absent in the background. Associating the scaling of the font-size to the hover effect, we were able to simulate a gradual zoom on the chosen area of the text. The images are already big because they are already more attractive and will probably play a leading role in media more and more in the future. The zoom on them reveals the related captions.</p>
