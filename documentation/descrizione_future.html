		<h2>2020-2040: Holographic Escape</h2>
		<p>Given the current environmental issues our society is challenged to face and the risks we are exposed to, it was unfortunately easy to think to a <b>dystopic future</b>. Inspired by landscapes as Blade Runner’s city, we chose to set our theme in ten years or so from now, in a <b>rainy overcrowded city</b>, where advertisement is invasive and pollution is just ignored, as it’s too difficult to fight. We imagined this hypothetical city in China, since it already counts a great number of megacities, which is likely to increase in the future. The background GIF drives us into this context.</p>

		<p>In such a context, a potential reader could search for a dimension where to grow apart from the surrounding chaotic environment and relax: a quiet shelter, as the nature. Therefore the page presents <b>natural elements from the forest landscape</b>, which commonly is the first thought when referring to nature. Surely it would result unknown and exotic for the majority of the citizens, but we further imagined it would be a distant concept also for the creator of the page, who, having just a superficial knowledge of the subject, makes some <b>association mistakes</b> for what concerns the relationship between the single elements: the pine cone doesn't properly belong to the trees represented, nor do the swifts usually fly over the forest.</p>
		<p>Inspired by the most updated tendencies in web design and by our perception of “futuristic”, we thought this representation should be <b>minimal</b>: black and white, with small standalone elements and a font in the body which has no particular features, but has commonly been used for long texts for ages, as Caslon. This was used together with "Quick Kiss" and "Garden Grown", two handwritten fonts, which remind of natural shapes. The choice of minimal design is also meant to create a greater contrast with the context, where everything is colorful and big to catch the attention.</p>
		<p>The reading support will probably keep evolving, as in the last decade. We envisioned a support which frees the reader from the screen, as the <b>hologram</b>, interposed between the subject and the surrounding environment, projected by a small invisible device (e.g. a watch). Images, tables and links present a shadow, as if they are 3D, popping out from the background.</p>

		</figure>
		<p>Reading in web has already changed a lot towards a <b>non-linear dimension</b>, so we imagined a future experience in which the reader can see at first glance the article as a whole and choose what attracts him most through the touch of the finger. This type of interaction is here simulated through the cursor, which is indeed absent in the background. Associating the scaling of the font-size to the hover effect, we were able to simulate a gradual zoom on the chosen area of the text. The images are already big because, as they already do today, they will probably play a leading role in media in the future. The zoom on them reveals the related captions.</p>
