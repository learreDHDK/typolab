                        <h2>XIX CENTURY NEWSPAPERS</h2>
                                                      
                  <p>The 19th century was marked by the second industrial revolution which led to the mass and cheap production of paper. This therefore favoured the prolifertion of newspapers since the level of literacy became high and there was the need to inform and be informed. Thus, this theme you are about to discover is mostly based on the newspapers produced during this epoch on many characteristics but also some aspects of the Victorian era. Below are the various explanations of the choices.</p>

                  <p><b>Header:</b> the header is a reproduction the article “Renolds’s  Miscellany” trying to reproduce the padding measurements, height, font size, margins and positions. This for the h1, h2, other elements and the header image.</p>

                  <figure>

                  <figcaption>fig1. style for the header elelements and the round image.</figcaption>
                  </figure>
                   
                  <p><b>Body:</b> The body style of my theme is not a direct copy of one 19th century newspaper but it was greatly influenced by this; 4 columns with a column rule. For the text European Directives, I chosed to create a two column body with border lines separating the little pieces of text. There are also certain aspects which I decided to include in order to have a vast representation of aspects of this era going from the fonts, image border, footer style, section division, header text underlining and padding.</p>

                  </figure>

                  <p><b>Font:</b> for this theme, I gave to the various elements a font size according to an eye resemblance since I could not find any information concerning the font sizes of that epoch. The choice of the various font families also where inspired by the sources. Not being able to find the same font, in some cases I looked for fonts having a sought of resemblance and which were created during this epoch. The font selected are:</p>

                  <ul>
                  <li>AbrilFatface-Regular(19th century): for the h1</li>
                  <li>De Vinne (1892): for the paragraphs of the main text</li>
                  <li>FREAS (before 2005): for the paragraphs in the footer so as to ressemble the font used in the reference text.</li>
                  <li>OldeEnglish (18th century) : for the h2</li></ul>

                  <p><b>Drop cap:</b> The first letter of each section has a drop cap effect as in the newspapers of the epoch.</p>

                     <figure>
                  <img src="themes/19th century/documentation/harpers head.jpg" alt="Reference for dropcap">
                  <figcaption>fig3. Creation of a dropcap which is similar to the original in font size,weight and margin.</figcaption>
                  </figure>                         

                  <p><b>Image:</b> the images are also in resemblance to the images found in the source documents in size and position. The header image is round since many images of this epoch were and the images in the text are square shaped as the ones from my sources. In addition, newspapers at the epoch used no image border but I decided to add the border effect in respect to Victorian style since this practice was very common then. Also you have the hover effect over the images if you are interested in viewing the image without the Victorian border.</p>
                         <figure>

                  </figure>

                  <p><b>Boxes:</b> the boxes in the text are again an imitation of the source content this is for the aside elements in the original documents.</p>

                  <figure>
                  <img src="themes/19th century/documentation/asides.jpg" alt="Reference for aside">

                  <p><b>Caption:</b> the captions of the images are at the bottom as in the source documents i.e. position and font size.</p>
                                                         
                  <figure>

                  <figcaption>Fig6. Copied the position</figcaption>
                  </figure>

                  <p><b>Emphasis: </b> parts of the original text that had an emphasis are represented as in a source document I found of that epoch and not in newspapers.</p>
                   
                   <figure>
                  <img src="themes/19th century/documentation/Text emphasis.jpg" alt="Reference for emphasis">
                  <figcaption>fig7. Tried to imitate and a create a special effect fo emphasised text</figcaption>

                  <p><b>Special effects:</b> for the end of a section and as a decoration for the h1 in the text I used a Victorian era section end indicator.</p>

                  </figure>

                  <p><b>Table:</b> I found no information concerning the tables of the epoch, so I decided to work more on the border style and background colour of the table heads. For the lottery tickets I copied a lottery paper of the period. So to the tables, I added the dotted effect.</p>

                  <figure>
                  <img src="themes/19th century/documentation/lottery.jpg" alt="Reference for tables">

                  <p><b>Footer:</b> The footer of the text is also in resemblance to a document I found of the period. That is a line above the text and the text having different widths.</p>
                  
                  <figure>
                  <img src="themes/19th century/documentation/footer style.jpg" alt="Reference for footer">
